After selection of the bioreactor, the program automatically runs through pre-rinse, caustic-detergent, acid-descaling, and post-rinse cycles. Individual valve seats are automatically pulsed to clean all aspects of the bioreactor and an airpush inbetween cycles reduces waste. This program replaced manual cleaning cycles which increased cleaning efficiency and allowed the control room operator to focus on more inportant tasks.",
